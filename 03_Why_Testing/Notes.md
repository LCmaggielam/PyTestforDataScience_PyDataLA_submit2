# What is a bug
A software bug is an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program - *Wikipedia*

## Division in Python 2 versus Python 3
* Default floor division in Python 2 is *not* a bug because its how Python 2 was designed to work
* Floor division in our program *is* a bug because its an error from what we wanted


## Testing helps catch bugs
Unit tests ensure logic is functioning as expected by telling a program to "do something" and then verifying the results

## Testing helps users understand the program
By reading the tests users can get a sense of what expected inputs and outputs are

## Testing helps with code development and refactoring 
By writing tests you help ensure that new code doesn't break existing functionality
